I'm creating this blog to post my adventures. In the last year I've gone on some really cool trips and local alpine missions. I post about them periodically on instagram but wanted a platform where I could write more details and post more pictures. These posts are more for myself to look back and remember all the cool things I've done, but hopefully at least some of these posts will help people with route beta and what not.
